Contribution guidelines for the client libraries.
===================================

* Only make changes to one client library per pull request.
* Tread carefully when changing the DTOs, backwards compatibility is very important.
* When creating a new library, install the base library using nuget, do not reference it.


## Code guidelines

* Read the [documentation](http://onetrueerror.com/documentation/client/extending.md)
* Follow the Microsoft Framework Design Guidelines
* 


Have fun!
